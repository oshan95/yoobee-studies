This project is to develop OOP application that is using SQLite3 to manage a college database designed in Week 3 - Activity 3.

The database include following entities,

1. student
2. course
3. teacher

Each of above tables will have couple of features which are listed in ER diagram. This application connects to an SQLite 
database and inserts sample data (7 records to "student" table, 2 records to "course" table, 2 records to "teacher" table
and to enroll students in courses, 2 records are inserted to student_course table and to assign teachers to courses 2 records
are inserted to teacher_course table) and performs SQL queries to retrieve number of students for MSE800 course and 
to list all teachers name who are teaching MSE801. The code includes inline comments for clarity.
