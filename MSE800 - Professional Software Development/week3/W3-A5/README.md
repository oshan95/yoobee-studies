This project is to develop OOP application that is using SQLite3 to manage a college database designed in Week 3 - Activity 3.

The database include following entities,

1. patient
2. doctor

Each of above tables will have couple of features which are listed in ER diagram. This application connects to an SQLite 
database and inserts sample data (7 records to "patient" table and 7 records to "doctor" table) and performs SQL queries to 
retrieve the full information of all patients who are classified as seniors in the clinic (age > 65 years) and
another query to display the total number of doctors who specialise in ophthalmology. 
The code includes inline comments for clarity.
